# Reporting Security Issues

VATSIM takes matters of security seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure of any findings.

To report a security issue, please email our senior technical staff at tech@vatsim.net.

Our team will then follow up with next steps, provided the issue is valid and reproducible.

As we work to resolve the issue, we will keep you informed of the progress, and may follow up with information and/or questions.
